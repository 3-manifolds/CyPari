environment:

  matrix:

    # For Python versions available on Appveyor, see
    # http://www.appveyor.com/docs/installed-software#python
    # A build job will be started for each definition below.

install:
  # Note that you must use the environment variable %PYTHON% to refer to
  # the interpreter you're using - Appveyor does not do anything special
  # to put the Python version you want to use on PATH.
  
  # Install python packages
  - "%PYTHON%\\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools"
  - "%PYTHON%\\python.exe -m pip install Cython six wheel future"

  # Build CyPari. 
  - "%PYTHON%\\python.exe setup.py build"

  # Put your test command here.
  - "%PYTHON%\\python.exe setup.py test"
  
after_test:

artifacts:
  # bdist_wheel puts your built wheel in the dist directory
  - path: Version2\dist\*.whl

#on_success:
#  You can use this step to upload your artifacts to a public website.
#  See Appveyor's documentation for more details. Or you can simply
#  access your wheels from the Appveyor "artifacts" tab for your build.
